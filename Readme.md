# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project has been created from scratch with help of the following programming languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  
The Frameworks used were:

* Bootstrap
* Luxon

With help of the OpenWeather One Call API we got the info required to know specific data about the current and 5-day forecasted weather in any city of the world, such as:

* Temperature
* Wind speed
* Humidity
* UV index

As a user your search history will be storaged in your viewport and you will be able to click in the search history to get the current and future conditions for that city.
